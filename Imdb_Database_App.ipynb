    "This Notebook provides context, documentation and sample code for a Database Application using IMBd datasets; for clarity, this document has been divided into the following sections:\n",

    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "### 2. Assumptions\n",
    "### 3. Logical Models\n",
    "### 4. Database and Relations Definition¶\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "#### 1.1. Looking at the data\n",
    "In this section, we analyze and deconstruct the various data sets found on the IMBd page; data is organized in seven TSV files, specifically:\n",

    "Title AKAs\n",
    "Title Basics\n",
    "Title Episodes\n",
    "Title Ratings\n",
    "Title Crew\n",
    "Name Basics\n",
    "Title Principles Our first step is to establish relationships between each data set and identify a primary key (PK) on each table. Since no information was provided regarding the role of columns, we devised a solution to find unique identifiers within each data set; that is, for each table we compare the total number of rows against the total number of unique values for a given column.\n",
    "1.2 Establishing PKs\n",
    "Following the system aforementioned, we identified the following primary keys"

I tried to mask them and they worked before but table insertion failed today- #### We could make a decision if we want to discard foreign keys tconst, parentTconst and nconst that dont map to a primary key in title_basics or name_basics table and consider them as bad data\n",
